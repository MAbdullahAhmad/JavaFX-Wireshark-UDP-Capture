I'm looking for a Java developer who can create a function that listens for serial port signals. Upon receiving a signal, the function should initiate a Wireshark capture and save the data to PostgreSQL, stopping when a stop signal is received. The project also includes creating an XML parser to merge XML data into a list of lists

I'm looking for a Java developer who can create a function that listens for serial port signals. Upon receiving a signal, the function should initiate a Wireshark capture and save the data to PostgreSQL, stopping when a stop signal is received. The project also includes creating an XML parser to merge XML data into a list of lists.

Key Requirements:
- Develop a Java function to listen for serial port signals.
- Start Wireshark capture upon receiving a signal.
- Save data to PostgreSQL.
- Stop capturing data upon receiving a stop signal.
- Create an XML parser to merge XML data into a list of lists.

Ideal Skills:
- Proficient in Java programming.
- Experience in working with hardware signals, specifically serial port signals.
- Familiarity with Wireshark and PostgreSQL.
- Knowledgeable in XML parsing.

Please note, the Java function is not required to handle multiple types of serial port signals, just a single type. The specific type of serial port signal to be handled has not yet been determined.
