there is a problem with my tshark command.
When i run:
tshark -i lo -f "host 127.0.0.1 and port 5555" -w /home/anderson/Documents/pkg/hakamsol/java/1-two-java-functions-wireshark/src/captures/capture_20240913_150441.pcap

it says following if i run with sudo:
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
Capturing on 'Loopback'
tshark: The file to which the capture would be saved ("/home/anderson/Documents/pkg/hakamsol/java/1-two-java-functions-wireshark/src/captures/capture_20240913_150441.pcap") could not be opened: Permission denied.

0 packets captured


And it says following if i do not run with sudo:
Capturing on 'lo'
tshark: Couldn't run /usr/bin/dumpcap in child process: Permission denied

0 packets captured
